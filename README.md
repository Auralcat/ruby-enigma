Reproduce the workings of the [Enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) using TDD.

Some more information:

- The sender types each letter of the message into a standard keyboard
- The signal passes through a plugboard which switches letters around
- There are more rotors that change the letters in the message

There's more information [here.](http://enigma.louisedade.co.uk/howitworks.html)
